// src/Radio.h — SX1262 radio lifecycle and packet I/O, implemented on
// top of RadioLib's SX1262 class. Board-specific pin numbers, TCXO
// voltage, RF-switch wiring, and VEXT rail come from the pre-included
// board header (include/board/<name>.h); this file is board-agnostic.
//
// This header replaces an earlier sibling-project sx126x driver port
// that turned out to have too many per-board quirks and deferred-
// dispatch gotchas. RadioLib is what Meshtastic/MeshCore use and
// handles all the low-level chip init, DIO1 interrupt routing, and
// callback plumbing transparently. See docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
// items #12-#14 for the failure modes that pushed us to switch.
